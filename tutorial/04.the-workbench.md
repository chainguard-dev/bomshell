# 4. The Interactive Workbench 

The `bomshell` CLI has an interactive workbench that lets users load SBOMs and
work with the files directly in the terminal.

This mode is in super-early-alpha-experimental-primitive state as of this
writing so you can skip this chapter of the tutorial. It will be completed
as the workbench is more solid and the UI is more defined.

To launch the interactive mode run:

```
bomshell interactive
```

This section of the tutorial is also here to let the reader know that the `Esc`
key is the way to exit the workbench :)
